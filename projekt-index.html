        <h3>Budgeting App</h3>
        <p>
          This is a budgeting app that I created using Svelte 5. The app allows
          you to add your income and expenses and it will calculate your total
          balance. You can also view your transactions and filter them by date.

        <h3>To-do list</h3>
        <p>
          This is a to-do list app that I created using React. The app allows
          you to add tasks to a list and mark them as completed. You can also
          filter the tasks by their status.

        <h3>Ecommerce Website</h3>
        <p>
          This is an ecommerce website that I created using HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript. The website allows you to browse products, add them to
          your cart, and checkout. You can also filter products by category.
