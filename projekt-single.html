        <h3>Budgeting App</h3>
        <a href="www.github.com">Github Repository</a>
        <p>
          This is a budgeting app that I created using Svelte 5. The app allows
          you to add your income and expenses and it will calculate your total
          balance. You can also view your transactions and filter them by date.
          The app features a user-friendly interface with real-time updates,
          making it easy to track your financial activities. <br />Additionally,
          it includes data visualization tools such as charts and graphs to help
          you better understand your spending habits. The app is designed to be
          responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile
          devices. Security measures are also implemented to protect your
          financial data.
